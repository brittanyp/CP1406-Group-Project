<strong>Adam LopezÂ <br>
(Vocal)</strong> &gt;Adam Lopez&rsquo;s exceptional vocal artistry has paved opportunities to perform backing vocals for some of the biggest names in the music industry such as Mariah Carey, Keith Urban and The Coors. His most recent noted collaboration was headlining with Australian Jazz legend James Morrison in a string of Symphonic Concerts in Perth, Hobart and Brisbane.Â <br>
<br>
His discography includes an eclectic collection of genres spanning from Pop-Opera, Pop, Rhythm &amp;Blues, Jazz, Power Ballads and Fiery Latin!Â <br>
<br>
His phenomenal vocal range smashed two Guinness World Records (one note above the range of a piano!)Â <br>
<br>
This achievement has astounded audiences from all around the world leading him to perform and appear on international television and radio stations in Japan, Spain, Italy, Korea, Hong Kong and the USA.Â <br>
<br>
Adam Lopez has undoubtedly got one of the most fascinating vocal instruments on the planet. He delighted audiences when he sang in Townsville with the Barrier Orchestra in 2012 along with Sean O&rsquo;Boyle and James Morrison.

<strong>Domenico TaraborrelliÂ <br>
(Accordion)</strong> Domenico is one of Brisbane&rsquo;s most experienced and versatile multicultural entertainers. He has performed in almost every possible style since he commenced his musical career in 1971 at age 4. He studied music on the traditional European instrument called the Piano Accordion and this is still his chosen instrument, although he also now uses the latest electronic midi accordion which incorporates other built in instruments.Â <br>
<br>
Domenico moved from three piece cabaret bands to a more sophisticated five piece band, the Latin Mafia which performs swing and Latin classics from the Rat Pack era.Â <br>
<br>
He has performed in many venues from QPAC with the Queensland Pops Orchestra to being runners up with his Celtic Band, Murphy&rsquo;s Pigs at the Tamworth Golden Fiddle Awards.

One of Australia&rsquo;s most respected and successful bassoon teachers at all levels, his teaching places great emphasis on the establishment of a close personal relationship with each one-to-one student, and on the development of a thorough understanding of the instrument and its techniques, the specifics of musical fabric and effect, and the various musical functions which the bassoon fulfils in varied styles and repertoires. This approach has yielded a remarkably high proportion of graduates who have established successful full-time careers as professional musicians both within Australia and overseas, as members of prominent orchestras, free-lancers, specialists in historically-informed performance on period instruments, instrumental teachers, and members of the armed services.</p></td>
