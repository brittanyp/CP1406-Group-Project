  <h2>Layout of the Orchestra</h2>
  <img src="images/layout.png" width="279" height="189" class="textwrap">
<p>The layout of the orchestra is often slightly different for every orchestra. As he/she is in
  charge, the conductor can decide how the instruments are to be arranged on the stage.
  This depends on many things – the instruments that are required for pieces that are to be
  performed in the concert, the size of the stage, the number of string instruments that are in
  each section.</p>
<p>The layout of the Barrier Reef Orchestra on the stage is slightly different to the above
diagram. In our program, a harp isn’t required, and when the piano is featured in ‘Rhapsody
in Blue,’ it is placed at the front as it features strongly as a solo. No matter what
arrangement the conductor decides on, the stringed instruments are always placed toward
the front of the orchestra. This is for a very practical reason – they are the quietest family of
instruments! If the loud brass or percussion instruments or were at the front of the
orchestra, the string instruments would most likely be drowned out!!</p>
<p>The violinist sitting closest to the conductor and closest to the edge of the stage, is the
concertmaster. This person is the leader of the orchestra. He/She has the job of organising
the tuning of the orchestra at the beginning of (and sometimes during) the concert. He/She
must also know the music well, as they often discuss details with the conductor. In the
Barrier Reef Orchestra, Stephen Frewen-Lord is our concertmaster. You will notice that his
movements are exaggerated so the other players can easily follow his lead, as well as keep
an eye on the concductor and their music.</p>

      <h2>Role of the Conductor</h2>
      <img src="images/conductpanel.jpg" width="900" height="243">
<p>In short, the role of the conductor in an orchestra is mainly to keep everyone together.
  During rehearsals, the conductor is responsible for determining how the music will be
  interpreted and for noticing and correcting any errors in how the musicians are performing.
  Usually, the conductor also chooses the repertoire of the orchestra for each concert or
  concert season.</p>
<p>The most important thing a conductor of an orchestra does is lead players through
rehearsals and performances. He or she accomplishes this in part by standing on a podium
in front of the musicians while executing a series of specific arm movements. The musicians
interpret these movements, gaining information such as how fast or loud to play. A
conductor learns standard conducting patterns as part of his or her education, but each
develops his or her own style or approach over time. Fundamental knowledge of every
instrument is standard, as well, and during the rehearsal process, conductors might
physically demonstrate or verbally describe exactly what they want orchestra members to
do.</p>
<p>All musicians in an orchestra must be proficient with their individual parts, but a conductor
of an orchestra has to learn entire scores because he or she functions as a musical traffic
director; cuing musicians so they enter or leave the musical highway at the right time. To
become familiar with a given score, a conductor generally studies it visually, paying
attention to theoretical considerations, such as instrumental transposition and harmonic
progression. He or she usually makes personal notes in the score as study and rehearsal
progress. Additionally, symphony conductors learn works by listening to recorded
performances, with some individuals having the capacity to visualize at least one
instrument's part at a time as they hear it. Some even hold mock performances for
themselves, "conducting" a recording of a performance to practice cuing and other patterns.</p>
<h3>Some Arm Movements of a Conductor</h3>
<p>If the music has a time signature of 4/4, this is the
movement of the conductor’s hand through the air.
Start at the high point and follow the numbers…<p>

  <h2>Concert Etiquette</h2>
  <img src="images/etiquette.jpg" width="493" height="176" class="centred">
<p>Live performance is truly magical! When you attend a performance, you are part of the
  experience. Live concerts are once-in-a-lifetime events - no single performance is like
  another.</p>
	<p>Undesirable behaviour as simple as taking a photograph, or having a conversation at the
wrong time, can ruin that moment for everyone in the Concert Hall. Unlike TV or movies,
which are the same on the screen whether you are watching or not. Live performance is
directly affected by the audience, so please follow these guidelines to allow everyone to
gain the most from the experience. Care about those around you, and those on the stage. </p>
	<p>This means:</p>
   	  <ul>
    	  <li>No talking, except quiet whispering between pieces</li>
          <li>Keep your mobile phone or any other electronic device turned off</li>
          <li>Clap at appropriate times. (In long pieces of music with a number of movements
such as Beethoven's Symphony No. 6, it is customary to applaud only at the end of
the piece and not after each movement.)</li>
		<li>Keep your hands and feet to yourself</li>
