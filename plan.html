<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>The goal of this website is to increase ticket sales of Barrier Reef Orchestra's events. The site is important as it gives information about the Orchestra and focuses on getting visiters to buy tickets. With an increase in sales the Orchestra will have more money to put towards their  community to increase the quality of their performances. </p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>The sites success will be evaluated by looking at ticket sales (ticket sales above 300/event is successful). </p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The target audience of this site is young people (20-30yrs). To cater to younger people the website will be modern looking while still informative. Each page will focus on specific topics and feature a 'classy' colour tone.</p>
